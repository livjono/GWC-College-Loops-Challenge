# GWC-College-Loops-Challenge
UCSB College Loops Challenge Website

This is our submission for the Girls Who Code College Loops Challenge! 

Sisterhood is the foundation of our project; we were inspired to create this website by our shared experiences as women in computer science. We want to help connect the women of Girls Who Code (both current and former) and create a safe space for GWC students to ask questions and voice concerns. Our final product not only exemplifies the GWC value of sisterhood, but also was made using an intentional process that ensured we practiced sisterhood throughout the full duration of our website’s creation.

When brainstorming ideas for our project, we wanted to practice sisterhood among one another and choose a project that was easily accessible and within everyone’s skill range. For this reason, we all came to an agreement and decided to learn more about web development – a topic none of us felt proficient in – since we found a free course on Codecademy (“How to Make a Website with Namecheap”) that was beginner-friendly. 
Throughout the process of creating our project, we bonded over shared difficulties we have had as women in tech. For example, our website’s Q&A feature and particularly the #coding channel arose out of our previous encounters with mansplaining; all of our team members have been talked down to after asking a coding question at some point in our respective times in CS and have felt subsequently discouraged from asking further questions. Our Q&A feature addresses this unfortunately all-too-common occurrence by creating a safe space for our members to ask any of the questions on their mind – whether it be about #coding, #careers, or anything #random. We want to foster a place of unabashed learning, encouragement, bonding, and growth. Additionally, we embodied the GWC value of sisterhood by coordinating our team members’ busy schedules and dividing up the work evenly throughout our entire process from start to finish. 

Our website is a platform that facilitates communication and connection between GWC members and alumnae. The #careers channel can be used to connect actively hiring alumnae with GWC members in search of a career opportunity. It can also be used for general advice on acquiring an internship, applying for jobs, choosing a career path, and navigating the modern workplace as a woman or nonbinary student in tech. The #random channel can be used for any miscellaneous topics and concerns GWC members would like to voice. It can also be used to give feedback to the site and make suggestions for any improvements.
